The password is pwny
You can leak the password with a timing attack
We're given the first character is 'p'
So you can guess it's pwny since thats also 4 and starts with 'p' 
But procedurally going through each letter and comparing 'pwa' 'pwn' you can see there is a longer delay with 'pwn' indication that it should be correct
